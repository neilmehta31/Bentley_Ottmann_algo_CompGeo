# Design and Analysis of algoritm Assignment 1
## How to run
Run the `./run.sh` file to run the algorithm followed by the plotting of the segments and the intersection points.
## Usage
`testcases.txt` file contains the segments in the specific form of `x1 y1 x2 y2`.<br />
`output.txt` file will contain the intersection points after running the algorithm.<br />
`plotting.py` contains the python script for plotting the segment. <br />
